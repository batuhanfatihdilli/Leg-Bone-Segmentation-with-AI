## Used Technologies
HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients): Extracted edge-based features for image analysis.

CoHOG (Co-occurrence of HOG): Captured spatial relationships between gradient patterns.

LBP (Local Binary Pattern): Used for local texture feature extraction.

Cross-Correlation & Fast Cross-Correlation: Applied for similarity measurement between images and label regions.

Patch Extraction: Divided images into smaller sections for localized processing.

Gradient Orientation & Sobel Operator: Computed edge directions and magnitudes.

Brightness Adjustment & Sharpening: Image enhancement techniques used during preprocessing.

Mean & L1 Norm: Used for image normalization and statistical consistency.

Pyramid Representation: Multi-scale image processing technique.

Shannon Entropy: Used as an information metric to evaluate preprocessing pipelines.

IOU (Intersection over Union): Evaluated the accuracy of predicted regions against ground truth.

Boundary Detection & Label Edge Evaluation: Assessed alignment of boundaries between label and prediction.

LabelMe Annotation Tool: Employed for manual labeling of dataset.

PyTorch & MONAI Frameworks: Used to build and train AI models for medical image analysis.

Adam Optimizer: Adaptive optimization method used during training.

Epoch-Based Learning: Iterative training over multiple cycles to optimize model accuracy.

Artificial Intelligence Model Training: Built and evaluated models using handcrafted features.
